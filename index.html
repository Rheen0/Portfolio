                    <p>As Technical Head for the STI College Marikina ICT Society Jr, I played a crucial role in
                        supporting the organization and assisting its senior members. I spearheaded the creation of
                        technical
                        solutions to ensure the smooth execution of various organization events. This involved close
                        collaboration with senior members to understand their event needs. I then
                        leveraged my technical expertise to develop these solutions. I also possess the ability to
                        troubleshoot
                        technical issues that arose during events. This leadership role also
                        fostered a collaborative and supportive team environment.</p>

                    <p>I thrived as a grade 11 & 12 Research leader at STI College Marikina, taking a leading role in
                        two impactful
                        projects: the Comfort Box and the STI College Marikina SHS Expo Information System. I wore
                        multiple hats, acting as the primary developer, ensuring technical execution, and crafting clear
                        documentation for both projects. My creative vision
                        played a key role in shaping these initiatives. Leading these projects honed
                        my ability to effectively communicate with my team, manage project timelines, and troubleshoot
                        any technical hurdles that arose. This experience
                        solidified my passion for research and development, while demonstrating my ability to excel in
                        both the technical and creative aspects of leading research projects.</p>

                    <p>For the STI College Marikina Senior High School Expo, I took on a multifaceted leadership role,
                        serving as the Head Creative & Graphics, and Head Technical. This experience allowed me to
                        leverage my strengths in both creativity and technical execution. I spearheaded the development
                        of the expo's visual identity, ensuring a cohesive and
                        impactful presentation. My technical expertise played a
                        crucial role in managing the expo's technological aspects. By effectively
                        leading and collaborating with the team, I ensured the expo ran smoothly and achieved its goals.
                        This experience honed my ability to manage
                        multiple tasks simultaneously, delegate effectively, and lead a team towards a common goal.</p>

                    <p>During my work immersion at DepEd Marikina, I excelled beyond my initial role as a junior

                        promotion to Project Manager for the intern team. In this leadership role, I thrived in a new
                        environment, effectively managing the interns' tasks and projects. This involved assigning tasks
                        based on each intern's strengths, coordinating with team members to ensure smooth collaboration,
                        and overseeing deadlines to keep the project on track. My ability to communicate clearly and
